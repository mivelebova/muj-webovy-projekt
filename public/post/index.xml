      <description>Vybrala jsem toto video proto, že vysvětluje, co to vlastně MMA je. Video se mi zdálo jednoduché a srozumitelné. Také se mi zdálo fajn vidět přímo prostředí, ve kterém zápasy probíhají.</description>

      <description>You’ll find this post in your content/post directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run command hugo server, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
To add new posts, simply add a file in the content/post directory that follows the convention name-of-post.</description>
